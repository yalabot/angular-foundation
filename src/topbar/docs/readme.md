A directive that provides the [Foundation Offcanvas](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/topbar.html) component.

The directive works out of the box with Foundation's CSS and has virtually itentical behavour. The following settings can be passed in as an object with the "options" attribute:

- `sticky_class`: Class name that will trigger sticky behaviour.
- `custom_back_text`: Set this to false and it will pull the top level link name as the back text.
- `back_text`: Define what you want your custom back text to be if custom_back_text.
- `is_hover`: Toggle drop down menus on hover.
- `mobile_show_parent_link`: will copy parent links into dropdowns for mobile navigation.
- `scrolltop`: jump to top when sticky nav menu toggle is clicked

See the demo page for example on how to use this and see the [Foundation docs](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/topbar.html) for more details.
