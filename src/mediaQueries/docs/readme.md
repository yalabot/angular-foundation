A module providing factories to aid in building responsive components.

The `matchMedia` factory provides either a shim for browsers without `window.matchMedia`, or `windows.matchMedia` itself.

The `mediaQueries` factory provides methods to detect if screen falls under the **small**, **medium** or **large** breakpoint.
