A lightweight off canvas directive that is focused on ... providing left and right off canvas screens!

There are no settings and so long as you include the offcanvas component as part of angular-foundation 
then this picks up the format from the off-canvas specification in foundation and uses that.

See the demo page for example on how to use this.
